Recommender
=======
This is a simple but efficient Recommender System in Python using collaborative filter. It uses Pearson Correlation Coefficients to recommend movies. It can also be used for other purposes.

I developed it because I was tired of getting recommendations of movies I had already watched, so I built my own system.
I have also a version on Kaggle using different data at:
